# **Plant**

## Description
This is a website created for plant lovers.  Users can search for various plants, choose from several options and be re-directed to a page just for that specific plant. This page contains facts about the plant, an option to "save to favorites" and a link to purchase from an outside source. If they choose, the user can create an account and by signing in they will go to a "My Garden" page where all their "favorites" have been saved.
